# Data-Gathering-Project
Collecting the data from different source into Dataframe object

## As a Data analyst the first step you have to do is to gather data from multiple sources . I have created multiple notebooks each  representing different sources of data. This repository can act as reference for anyone who wants to collect data from different sources. I have also provided the differnt types( eg-.csv, .json, .xlsx) of dataset which you can use for practice.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project covers five major data gathering techniques:
1. **CSV Files** — Loading data using pd.read_csv() and exploring differnt types of paramters provided by the function .
2. **Excel Files** — Reading multiple sheets .
3. **JSON Files** — Parsing and normalizing nested JSON structures into tabular format.
4. **APIs** — Fetching real-time data using `requests` and converting it to a DataFrame.
5. **Web Scraping** — Extracting data from websites using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
5. **My SQL Databse** — Extracting data from database and load it into pandas Dataframe using `My sql.connector` and `Sqlalchemy` library.
